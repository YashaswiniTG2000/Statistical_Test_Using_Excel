Statistical_Test_Using_Excel

In this project, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of categorical data using various statistical techniques.

Statistical Techniques Employed:
 1. One-Sample T-Test
 This test was used to determine if the mean of a single sample differs significantly from a known or hypothesized population mean.
 2. Two-Sample T-Test
 I performed this test to compare the means of two independent samples to assess whether they are statistically different from each other.
 3. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
 ANOVA was utilized to evaluate the differences among group means in a sample, allowing for the comparison of three or more groups simultaneously.
 4. Paired T-Test
 This test was conducted to compare two related samples, measuring the same subjects under different conditions to identify any significant differences.
 5. Regression Analysis
 I implemented regression analysis to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables, helping to predict outcomes based on input data.
 6. Data Visualization
Throughout the analysis, various graphical representations such as bar charts, pie charts, and column charts were created to visualize the frequency distributions and results of the statisticalÂ tests.
